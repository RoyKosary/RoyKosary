## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Roy Kosary, and I’m a Computer Science graduate from **Bar-Ilan University** 🎓.  
I'm currently looking for my next opportunity to join a **challenging and dynamic environment**, where I can contribute, grow, and continue learning.

## 💡 About Me
- Proficient in **C++**
- Strong understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Experience with **Modern C++** standards (C++11 and above)
- Comfortable using the **STL (Standard Template Library)**
- Currently practicing problem solving on **LeetCode**

## 🛠️ What's coming
I'm actively working on improving my skills, and I plan to **upload weekly or monthly** content:  
projects, code samples, and algorithm challenges — all part of my journey to becoming a better software developer.
